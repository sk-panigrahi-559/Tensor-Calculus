# Tensor Calculus Notes

Notes on tensor calculus based on Andrew Dotson's video lectures.

## Overview

- This repository contains concise notes on the fundamental concepts of tensor calculus.
- These notes are designed as a supplementary resource for those studying tensors.

### Source
These notes are based on [Andrew Dotson's Tensor Calculus](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSuQRd4LfSUTmb_7IK7kAzxJtU2tpmEd3&si=2F-HXMEztvDDttu9)  video series.

## Topics Covered
This repository includes notes on:

- **Introduction to Tensors:** Scalars, vectors, matrices, and higher-order tensors
- **Tensor Notation and Indexing:** Einstein summation, Kronecker delta, and Levi-Civita symbol
- **Tensor Operations:** Addition, multiplication, contraction, and outer products
- **Transformation Laws:** Covariant, contravariant, and mixed tensors
- **Metric Tensors:** Concepts in Riemannian curvature tensory
- **Differentiation of Tensors:** Covariant differentiation, tensor fields
- Application in gravity (not added - may add later)

## Prerequisites
To get the most out of these notes, familiarity with the following topics is recommended:

- Linear Algebra: Basics of vectors and matrices, matrix operations, and transformations
- Multivariable Calculus: Partial derivatives, gradients, and integration

## Desclaimer
This is my personal notes and reflect my understanding of tensor calculus concepts. While I've made every effort to ensure accuracy, there may be errors or omissions.

Thank you for reading.
